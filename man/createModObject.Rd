createModObject(data, sim = NULL, pathInput, currentTime,
  fun = readRDS)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{character string of the object or file name to be searched for}

\item{sim}{simList. Default is `NULL`.}

\item{pathInput}{path to the directory containing the files to be searched for.}

\item{currentTime}{Numeric. Current time to be used to serach for the object.}

\item{fun}{function to be used to recover the file. Default is `readRDS`}
