\usage{
createModels(caribouCoefTable = NULL, modelsToUse = "M3")

prepareClimateLayers(pathInputs = NULL, variables = NULL,
  years = NULL, GDriveFolder = NULL, climateFilePath = NULL,
  fileResolution = NULL, authEmail = NULL, RCP = NULL,
  climateModel = NULL, ensemble = NULL, rasterToMatch = NULL,
  studyArea = NULL, model = NULL, doughtMonths = 4:9,

}
\arguments{
\item{caribouCoefTable}{data.table of the coefficient values for all models available. If not provided,
will use as default the one from ECCC 2011 for population demographics.}

\item{modelsToUse}{Character string of the model to be used. Currently only "M3" and "M7" (demograohics)
and "TaigaPlains" (RSF) have been implemented. Default is "M3".}

\item{variables}{Character string of the variables to be used, i.e. c("PPT", "Tmax").}

\item{years}{Character string of the years to use. i.e. c(2011:20100).}

\item{GDriveFolder}{Character string of the folder in google drive to upload the layers to. Handy for shared projects.}

\item{climateFilePath}{Character string of the path to the climate file in google drive
(i.e. "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wcgytGJmfZGaapZZ9M9blfGa-45eLVWE" for
`Canada3ArcMinute.7z`)}

\item{fileResolution}{Character string of the for naming purposes (i.e. `3ArcMinute`)}

\item{authEmail}{Character string of googledrive e.mail for authentication for non-interactive use.}

\item{RCP}{Character string of RCP to be used (i.e. `45`)}

\item{climateModel}{Character string of climate mode to be used (i.e. `CanESM2`)}

\item{ensemble}{Character string of climate ensemble to be used (i.e. `r11i1p1`)}

\item{rasterToMatch}{RasterLayer template for these layers to match}

\item{studyArea}{shapefile of study area}

\item{model}{For naming and shortcut for variables: ie. `birds` or `fireSense`.
If you wanna provide the variables to be produced, don't use birds or fireSense here.}

\item{doughtMonths}{numeric. Months for fireSense to calculate MonthDoughtCode (MDC) i.e. `4:9`.}

\item{returnCalculatedLayersForFireSense}{Logical. Should it calculate MDC (TRUE) or return the original variables (FALSE)? Default is FALSE.}

\item{yearsWithClimateProjections}{Numeric. The user can pass the years that have climate projection in the data. Default to 2011:2100.}

\item{overwrite}{logical. Default to FALSE. Should the layers be overwritten if exist?}

\item{overwriteOriginalData}{logical. Default to FALSE. If changes happen in the original layer (the one provided in climateFilePath),
set this to TRUE to overwrite the zip files downloaded.}
}
\value{
names list of the quote of the model that can be parsed to generate the simulated data bootstrapped
        using the model coefficients.

This function returns a list of all years, with each year being the local path for the raster stack that contains all variables
}
\description{
Designed as a helper to create caribou models based on 2011 ECCC report on population demographics and RSF.
This function uses \code{usefun::createEquation()} internally

Function to create raster stack for climate sensitive models. Designed primarily for NWT project, but somewhat flexible.
