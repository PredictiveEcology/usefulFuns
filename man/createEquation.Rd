\title{createEquation writes an equation based on a data.frame (or data.table), bootstraping a
set of covariates around the standard error present in the table.}
\usage{
createEquation(model, replicates = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{data.frame. Needs to have as column names 'Coefficient', and 'Value' and 'StdErr' for a
given parameter. The model table NEEDS to have at least two rows, one being the 'Intercept'
as 'Coefficient'. If 'Intercept' is not found, it enters \code{browser()} mode.}

\item{replicates}{numeric. Number of repetitions to be added to the bootstrapping.}
}
\value{
As with \code{\link[archivist]{cache}}, returns the value of the
function call or the cached version (i.e., the result from a previous call
to this same cached function with identical arguments).
