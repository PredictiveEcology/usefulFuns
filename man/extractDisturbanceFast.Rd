\title{extractDisturbanceFast extracts disturbance of anthropogenic and fire}
\usage{
extractDisturbanceFast(ageMap, caribouShapefile, recoveryTime = 40,
  anthropogenicLayer = NULL, waterRaster, rasterToMatch)
}
\arguments{
\item{ageMap}{RasterLayer. Map with forest age.}

\item{caribouShapefile}{Shapefile with polygons for which we want to calculate lambda for the caribou demographic model.}

\item{recoveryTime}{numeric. Recovery time in years that the forest needs to support Caribou. Default = 40.}

\item{anthropogenicLayer}{Anthropogenic disturbance (raster) layer. Currently, road density layer used for both RSF and demographic models.}

\item{waterRaster}{Raster layer indicating water bodies.}

\item{rasterToMatch}{RasterLayer template for these layers to match.}
}
\value{
A list of the anthropogenic and fire disturbances as percent (0-100)
